# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A Tic Tac Toe Game where number of user wins is stored in a txt file, and retrieved from it to be displayed to user.

# How to use
First, you need to open the "tictactoe_welcome_screen.py" file; from it, you can create a new account for each user.

# I will upload the game as .exe file soon.
